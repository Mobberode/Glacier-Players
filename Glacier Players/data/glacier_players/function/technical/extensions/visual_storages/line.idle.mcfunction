Not only are they in the neutral element group, which is where humans are, they also tower over humans, which means they are easily large enough to handle human dicks. And with their aggressive personality, not only can you be rough with one but they can rough with you! And with their ability to drop Strange Juice and Cake, I am certain not only would they be moist, but bouncy as well. They also have both Lv 2 handiwork and medicine suitability along with no fur to cover its nipples, so itd be incredibly easy to get you in the mood and keep you there. Lastly, with its ability to steal energy from its enemies, it means that its ability to take a pounding will never run out. So without a doubt in my mind, Lovander is the best Pal built for human dick."}'},{contents:'{"text":"I need attention urgently"}'},{contents:'{"text":"garten gart gart"}'},{contents:'{"text":"Maybe we the Glacier Players and the Lambda Players or the Zeta Players arent the same"}'},{contents:'{"text":"Sometimes I feel like a glaceon created me but at the same time.
