## Code contribution guidelines
- **Optimization and Efficiency**

Glacier Players attempts to use the most optimizations that are possible like macro caching to reduce the amount of selectors. Tick performance matters when mods and other datapacks are being used so consider the performance of the code when contributing.

- **Modular**

Glacier Players allow extensions to build upon existing systems like the hunger system via allowing more food items to be recognised and eaten. Code should be for the most part modular for freedom with extensions if possible.

- **Player Accuracy**

Glacier Players aim to replicate the actions of a player and while it may be impossible to exactly replicate it perfectly with the limitations of data packs. Its essential that most details about real players are in Glacier Players. If you wish to make something more accurate. You can read the Minecraft Wiki or trustworthy sources on how everything works.
