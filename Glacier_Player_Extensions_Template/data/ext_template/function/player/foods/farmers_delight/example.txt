You can make modded items such as the tomato from the farmers delight mod compatbible with Glacier Players!

You will have to make compatibilty with them yourself in .mcfunction
You can copy from the Glacier's code!

Example:
$execute if items entity @s horse.$(player_inv_slot) farmers_delight:beef_stew as @e[limit=1,tag=GlacierPlayer.Player_Selected] run function ext_template:player/foods/farmers_delight/beef_stew
